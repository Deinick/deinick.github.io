    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <img src="images/photo_portfolio.jpg"> <!-- ADD alt.text-->
    <p>I’m Nikolay Deinego — a Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University in Canada, an aspiring software developer, and AI researcher. With a deep passion for both code and communication, I combine technical precision with creative energy to design systems that not only function, but connect, teach, and inspire. I specialize in translating complex ideas into elegant solutions — whether through software, video, or spoken word. Beyond development, I thrive in roles that involve teaching, presenting, and leading; I believe knowledge is most powerful when shared. Off-screen, you’ll find me at the piano or in front of a camera, crafting educational and thought-driven content. I'm fluent in two languages, currently studying Chinese, and deeply committed to personal growth, discipline, and creative expression. My path is defined by passion, clarity of vision, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence.</p>
